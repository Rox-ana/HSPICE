The InvCMOS contains the HSPICE code for CMOS inverter.
I have used the mosistsmc180.lib
For convenience, I have appended the library at the end of the file.
It was my Digital Electronic homework.
The purpose of this project was to calculate Tr, Tf, TpLH, TpHL, and power for various (W/L) in both PMOS and NMOS.
This source code shows the one where W/L for PMOS is 1 and for NMOS is 2.
