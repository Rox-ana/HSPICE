The fulladder contains the HSPICE code for CMOS fulladder.
I have used the mosistsmc180.lib
For convenience, I have appended the library at the end of the file.
It was my Digital Electronic homework.
The purpose of this project was to calculate Tr, Tf, TpLH, TpHL, average propagation delay, and power.
