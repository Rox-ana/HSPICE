I have used the 45nm library.
For convenience, I have appended the library at the end of the file.
It was my VLSI project.
The purpose of this project was to implement three different approximate adders, find the wrong outputs and determine the path that created it, and calculate static power, dynamic power, and highest delay.
The fist adder is a ten-transistor precise full adder.
